FUNCTIONS
    main(argv)
        Import users and groups from a file. The file has to be generated by exportUsersAndGroups.py or a self-made corresponding infacmd command line.
        usage: importUsersAndGroups.py [-h] -i INPUT_FILE [-r {false,true}]
        where:
        -r determines whether (true) or not (false) existing users and groups in the target environment should be re-used.
        Check the Informatica documentation for further information on importing users and groups with infacmd.
    
    parse_the_arguments(argv)
        Parses the provided arguments and exits on an error.
        Use the option -h on the command line to get an overview of the required and optional arguments.
